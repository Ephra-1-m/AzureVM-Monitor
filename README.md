<p align="center">
The virtual machine is connected to Azure Log Analytics for log monitoring and analysis. A public IP address is used for security purposes, and the VM is also connected to the virtual network for proper integration. Additionally, alert rules are configured to monitor specific events, such as successful RDP logins, and trigger notifications when conditions are met.<br/>

Signed in to the VM using RDP with the username and password created during the VM setup. After logging in, PowerShell was used to print the private IP address of the VM, which is part of the Azure Virtual Network, showing the IP as 10.0.0.4. <br/>
